// let guest_list : string[] = ["Salman", "Hadi", "Rayyan"];    ///List of three peoples

// guest_list.forEach(geust => {
//     console.log(`Dear, ${geust}  would you like to join me for the dinner today ? `);             //Print message with the each person
    
// })




// let name = "shalom";

// if ("Shumaila") {
